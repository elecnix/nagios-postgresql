1) Using psql or pgadmin, run pg_stat_activity.sql on the databases to be 
monitored. This will install a function that will let non super users "see" 
the contents of the current query. 

(Enter your IP and database superuser information if different)
$ psql -U postgres -h 192.168.1.10 postgres

postgres=# \i pg_stat_activity.sql
CREATE FUNCTION

If you get "ERROR:  language "plpgsql" does not exist", create it:

$ createlang -U postgres -h 192.168.1.10 plpgsql postgres


2) If desired, add a non super user to monitor your databases. 

$ psql -U postgres -h 192.168.1.10 postgres

postgres=# CREATE USER nagios WITH PASSWORD 'something_secret';
CREATE USER


3) Make sure your pg_hba.conf is setup to allow appropriate access from your 
nagios machine. If your monitoring machine is 192.168.1.99 and you only want 
to allow a single user called "nagios" to access the database called "postgres",
 you could use a line like so:

# this is for postgresql 8.1+
# The user 'nagios' can connect to the database 'postgres' from 192.168.1.99 with a password
host    postgres    nagios      192.168.1.99/32       md5

# this is for postgresql 8.0 
# The user 'nagios' can connect to the database 'postgres' from 192.168.1.99 with a password
host    postgres    nagios      192.168.1.99   255.255.255.255       md5

If you want a full discussion of pg_hba.conf see:
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/client-authentication.html


4) Make sure your postgresql.conf is setup for monitoring. If you want to do 
"query profiling" using check_pg_queries.pl, you'll *NEED* these variables changed. 

# edit these 2 lines in your postgresql.conf to allow query profiling
stats_start_collector = true
stats_command_string = true


5) If you changed your pg_hba.conf or postgresql.conf, you'll need to reload 
your postgresql config files. If you have a start/stop script you can use that,
 or you can use pg_ctl directly like so.

[pgsql@localhost bin]$ ./pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data/ reload
postmaster signaled

NOTE: If you have changed "stats_start_collector" from above, you will need to
restart your postgres, not just reload the config file. 


6) Test the function as non super user from your nagios machine.

psql -U nagios -h 192.168.1.10 -p postgres
(enter password when prompted)

postgres=> SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity();
 datid | datname  | procpid | usesysid | usename | current_query |          query_start
-------+----------+---------+----------+---------+---------------+-------------------------------
 17230 | postgres |   18925 |      108 | nagios  | <IDLE>        | 2006-08-29 11:06:58.869604-07
(1 row)


=========================================================================

PROBLEM:  You are seeing "command string not enabled".

1) double check you have setup your postgresql.conf file correctly.
2) Make sure you have reloaded/restarted postgres.

7) Test connection to database by invoking script:

$ /path/to/check_pg_connections.pl -H 192.168.1.10 -U user -P password

If you get "Can't locate DBI.pm", on Debian you can install the required modules with:

$ sudo apt-get install libdbi-perl libdbd-pg-perl
